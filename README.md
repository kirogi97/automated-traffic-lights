Automated Traffic Lights
This project implements an automated traffic light system designed to optimize vehicle flow at a roundabout. By dynamically adjusting signal durations based on traffic volume in each lane, it prioritizes heavily congested areas to reduce waiting times and enhance overall efficiency. The model serves as a simplified approach for simulating traffic management scenarios.

Features
Dynamic signal adjustment based on traffic volume.
Prioritization of congested lanes to improve throughput.
Simplified implementation for easy testing and adaptation.
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/kirogi97/automated-traffic-lights.git
cd automated-traffic-lights
Install required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the traffic light optimization model:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Customize traffic parameters in the code to simulate different scenarios.
Future Improvements
Integration with real-world data: Incorporate live traffic data from sensors or cameras.
Multi-lane support: Extend the model to handle multiple lanes and intersections.
Advanced algorithms: Use machine learning models for more adaptive and predictive traffic management.
Visualization tools: Add graphical interfaces to display simulations and outputs.
